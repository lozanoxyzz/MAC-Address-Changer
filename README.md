I created a MAC Address changer for linux, build on python
You have an access to help options but you just need to put your interface and the mac address that you want to have
##### Dont forget this just work the time you use it, after turn it off or reboot your computer your MAC Address going to be the original one #####

Also you need to have access to ifconfig and download Python (Python 2 and 3 works)
